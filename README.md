# TwoPlayerPlatformer
Created: March 20, 2018

Description:
This is a two player competitive action platformer. To win, a player must kill the other player. Each player controls their own unique character. One character has a shotgun which shoots slowly but shoots several bullets at a time. The other character has a machinegun which can shoot rapidly but each bullet does only a small amount of damage. 

Each character has a stamina bar which a player can use to temporarily move faster. The stamina bar regenerates over time. Each character can also stick to and jump off walls. 

Their is only one level but the level is packed with static and moving platforms. Certain platforms will do damage over time when a character touches it. Also, if either character goes outside the level's boundaries, they will instantly die.
